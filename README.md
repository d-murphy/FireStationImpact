## Impact of Construction of an Additional Fire Station

This project was both an academic exericse and pro bono investigation for a small volunteer fire department condsidering the construction of an additional fire station.  A model was created to simulate the department's response which allowed an understanding of how response times would change with the new station.

Contained here are the data visualizations used in forming the model, a map of the district showing changes to response times according to the Google Maps API, and some of the code used in data manipulation.  

Simulation, as required by the course, took place in Excel.  The results were important.  Construction of the fire station alone would not reduce response times.  A sufficient enough response at the new station along with no drop-offs in response at existing stations was required to see an improvement in average response times.
